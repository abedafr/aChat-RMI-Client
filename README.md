# aChat-RMI-Client
basic chat desktop application that works with JavaRMI.

you should run the server first, it is <a href="https://github.com/abedafr/aChat-RMI-Server">here</a>

## What is It?
this application is a simple sever-client based chat group.

you just need to provide your name (also ID) and The server IP address.

built using Java and JavaRMI, for the GUI I used JavaFX, with This framework: <a href="https://github.com/jfoenixadmin/JFoenix">JFoenix</a> which adds a beautiful Material design touch to the app.
